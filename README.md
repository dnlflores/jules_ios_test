# jules_ios_test

This project demonstrates using a custom variable font named **Playpen Sans**. The font file is located under `JulesPoke/Fonts/` and is loaded via the `UIAppFonts` entry in `Info.plist`. You can use the helper methods `Font.playpenSans(size:)` and `UIFont.playpenSans(ofSize:weight:)` to apply this font across the app.
